- **TypeScript** and **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Notion API** used as the CMS for logbook posts, photo shoots and workbench projects
- **GitHub API** integration to enrich workbench projects
- **Upstash Redis** to store perâ€‘page view counts
- **Radix UI** primitives for accessible UI components
- Basic search and tag filtering across all collections
- Simple API route for retrieving page view statistics
- Vitest tests for the Notion client
